# lru-pcache

An LRU cache for promises. Developer friendly

## Features

 - Promisification: Async ready to easily change to a memcached/redis implementation
 - Improved get method, to make more expressive usage of the pattern "if not found
 in the cache, go get it, store in the cache, and return the value"
 - Funnel values: Promises are stored and returned, so if the value for a key
 is being obtained while another get is requested, the promise of the value is returned
 so only one request for value is done
 - Compatible with non-promises methods

>  100% coverage

## Basic Usage
```sh
npm install lru-pcache
```

```js
const { Cache } = require('lru-pcache');

const cache = new Cache({ // see https://github.com/isaacs/node-lru-cache#options for options
  max: 50, // # of items
  maxAge: 10 * 60 * 1000, // expiration in ms (10 min)
});

// The old method without cache
const getCarUncached = async (name) => {
  const { data } = await axios.get(`https://example.com/cars/${name}`);
  return data;
});

// With cache: easy addinng
const getCar = async (name) => cache.get(name, async () => {
  const { data } = await axios.get(`https://example.com/cars/${name}`);
  return data;
});

await volvo = await getCar('Volvo');
await cache.del('Volvo'); // delete from cache
await cache.reset(); // clear cache
```
